According to the retiring_titles table, which contains the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring, there are 7 roles that will need to be filled. There are 41,380 employees that will be eligible for retirement, according to the retirement_eligibility table. However, there are 72,458 titles from the retiring_titles table. This means that there is a tremendous number of qualified and experienced employees that will be leaving the company.

-Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The are 1549 qualified, retirement-ready employees who could be a part of the Silver Tsunami mentorship program. This may not be enough resources to replace the mass silver exodus the company is anticipating.
